        <h3>Dust Collector Market</h3>
        <p>
            In NZ, growth can be mainly attributed to increased industrial manufacturing, infrastructure development and global economic activity.
            Dust collectors help by eradicating the contaminants to achieve a more hygienic environment, something which is essential many sectors and manufacturers in NZ.
        </p>
        <p>
            Dairy and associated milk products, along with Food & Beverage manufacturers accounted for a large market share increase recently, mainly due to the need to maintain a high level of quality control in the industry Clean Room premises.
        </p>
        <p>
            Government regulation for emission control will be further regulated to monitor hazardous air pollutants (HAP) that are emitted from various industries by controlling and limiting the polluted air from the source.
            These regulations will increase the use of industrial dust collectors to limit the emission and will therefore boost the demand of dust collectors.
        </p>

        <p>
            Companies engaged in developing filter based technologies to reduce emissions include media such as Cellulose, Polyester, Synthetic, Coated, Non-Woven Cartridges along with woven and non-woven filter media.
            The adoption of dust collectors in food & beverages industries has increased, mainly due to rising health concerns among consumers. Preferences for packaged food are also worth noting but it will also be interesting to see what happens with the demands for less plastic and also waste trends that can affect sustainability.

    <div>
        <h3>Insect Filters</h3>
        <p>
            Insect filtration is commonly referred to as “MESH”. The sizing is generally relative to the gap in the mesh and measured in microns.
            Mesh is simply a barrier made of connected strands of synthetic fibre, metal fibre, or other flexible / ductile materials.
        </p>
        <p>
            Think of a mesh as being similar to a web or a net that has lots of woven strands. As an analogy, will the mesh you use be capable of catching baitfish or whitebait?
            Plastic mesh may be extruded, expanded, woven or tubular and usually made from nylon, polyethylene, PTFE, polypropylene or PVC.
        </p>
        <p>
            Metal mesh can be woven, welded, knitted, expanded, photo-chemically etched or electroformed (screen filter) from steel or other metals.
        </p>
        <p>Fiberglass mesh can be used to create new products such as door screens, filtration components, and reinforced adhesive tapes. It is commonly sprayed with a PVC coating to make it stronger, last longer, and to prevent skin irritation.</p>
        <p>
            Coiled wire fabric is a type of mesh that is constructed by interlocking metal wire coils via a simple corkscrew method. The resulting spirals are then woven together to create a flexible metal fabric panel. It is also used in industrial sectors to protect personnel and contain debris.
        </p>
        <h4>Uses</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>To screen out insects. Wire screens on windows and mosquito netting are meshes. </li>
            <li>Metal and nylon wire mesh filters can be used in liquid filtration. </li>
            <li>Guarding for secure areas and as protection (vandal screens). </li>
            <li>Larger open mesh sizes can be fabricated to produce waste baskets and other containers for material handling.</li>
            <li>Used in liquid filtration for debris capture and containment.</li>
            <li>Used to protect chemical and paint pumps and other sensitive valves or devices.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Frames can be assembled with Aluminium or Stainless Steel for most applications.</p>

@if (Model.ProductName == "Compact Filters")
{
    <div>
        <h3>Compact Filters</h3>
        <p>
            Compact Filters, aka Compact Pleated Filters are very fine filters and the frames or surrounds are usually made from ABS, Plastic moulded, or in some cases Stainless or Galvanised Steel.
        </p>
        <p>
            Filter Media can be Glass Fibre, Synthetic, Activated Carbon, possibly Mini Pleat structure. Most have water resistant media and excellent water drainage qualities.
        </p>
        <p>
            Full size and Half size (dimensions will vary depending on specifications).
            A gasket is usually used to reduce filter bypass.
        </p>
        <h4>Applications</h4>
        <p>
            Hospitals / HVAC / AHU’s / Food and Beverages / Pharmaceuticals / Clean Rooms /  Semi-Conductors / Power Generation / Medical facilities / Automotive and Aircraft.

        <h3>HEPA Filters</h3>
        <p>
            Originally called high-efficiency particulate absorber but also sometimes called high-efficiency particulate arresting / arrestance HEPA was commercialized in the 1950s, and the original term became a registered trademark and later a generic term for highly efficient filters.
        </p>
        <p>
            HEPA filters are often used by those who have asthma and severe allergy problems since these filters actually improve indoor air quality. They are one of the most efficient filters on the market.
        </p>
        <p>
            Varying standards define what qualifies as a HEPA filter. (efficiency at 99.97% on 0.3 micron and higher particle size).
            Filter Media is commonly Glass Fibre or Synthetic. The frame, gasket, faceguard, efficiency, ratings, separator and sealants vary according to specifications.
        </p>
        <h4>Important:</h4>
        <p>
            Each HEPA filter should have its very own certificate of compliance and test results from the factory.
        </p>
        <h4>Applications</h4>
        <p>
            Generally used for HVAC high-volume airflow equipment and areas where very fine filtration is required.
        </p>
        <p>
            Hospitals / HVAC / AHU’s / Food and Beverages / Pharmaceuticals / Clean Rooms /  Semi-Conductors / Power Generation / Medical facilities / Automotive and Aircraft.

        <h3>Liquid Filtration</h3>
        <p>
            Sometimes also referred to as Mono, Spun, or Multi Filament filter elements. Liquid filtration filter sizing is generally relative to the gap in the “Mesh” (measured in microns).
        </p>
        <p>
            Liquid Filter Mesh is simply a barrier made of connected strands of synthetic fibre, metal fibre, or other flexible / ductile materials.
        </p>
        <p>
            When carefully considered, a liquid filtration system will offer many benefits such as:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Minimising process downtime.</li>
            <li>Reduction and possibly elimination of waste disposal costs.</li>
            <li>Limiting employee exposure to any harmful process liquids.</li>
            <li>Maintenance reductions.</li>
            <li>Reducing manufacturing downtime.</li>
            <li>Product quality improvements.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Plastic mesh may be extruded, expanded, woven or tubular and usually made from nylon, polyethylene, PTFE, polypropylene or PVC.
            There are also specific filter elements available for moisture separation of process oils / mists or high moisture conditions.
        </p>
        <p>
            Liquid Bag filters generally have the lowest equipment investment costs, and are tolerant of a wide range of process conditions.
        </p>
        <h4>Applications</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Sediment capture and Debris containment </li>
            <li>Chemicals, paint and pharmaceutical industries </li>
            <li>Process and Industrial filters </li>
            <li>Oil / Water Separators </li>
            <li>Metalworking fluids</li>
            <li>Water Purification and Drinking Water Filters</li>
            <li>Wastewater Treatment</li>
            <li>Upstream Protection of pumps, instruments, valves or dispensing devices</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Filter Frames can be made using Steel, Aluminium or Stainless Steel for most applications. There are many types of retaining rings / wire formations that can be utilised to suit the various liquids to be filtered and the filter housings.
