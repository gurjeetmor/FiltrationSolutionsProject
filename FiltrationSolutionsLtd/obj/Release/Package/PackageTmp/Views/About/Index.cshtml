        <h4>About Chris</h4>
        <p>
            I grew up in Orakei, Auckland, and played rugby for many years amongst other sports. I proudly support the All Blacks, Vodafone Warriors and the Chiefs.
            Educated at Orakei Primary and Selwyn College, I then completed an apprenticeship in Fitting, Turning and Machining. At this stage I was also involved in Surf Lifesaving at Muriwai and other watersports.
            Having a trade background, I then travelled NZ and Australia, before venturing off on the big OE. With a bag of tools, I was primarily involved in Preventative Maintenance of  Building Services, along with mechanical installations and commissioning.

        </p>
       
        <p>
            I must admit having seen many historic places and architectural exhibits, the OE experience and the exposure to people from various cultural backgrounds was truly humbling.
            Returning to NZ I was employed in an engineering service management role with boilers, burners, thermal oil and warm air furnaces. Being at the coalface was exciting and this experience of finding specific solutions for industrial clients was extremely satisfying.
            Finding staff for industrial clients was the next step, so I started specialising as an Industrial Recruiter for many years, mainly Blue Collar, mechanical and electrical.

        </p>
        <p>
            Other roles involved Air Compressors and Air Treatment servicing and Aftermarket Sales, technical sales for commercial Natural Gas sector, Websites and then Air Filtration.
            Most recently I was involved in reactive and preventative maintenance for a meat processing and packaging plant.
            I live in Mt Wellington and have a daughter called Sinead who has completed her Psychology degree, (probably lots of “at home” research here). I also have 5 awesome nephews.
            My main hobbies are recreational fishing and 8 Ball.

        </p>
        <p>
            The new branch at Auckland is set up and I look forward to visiting various clients around New Zealand soon.
            I genuinely care about the safety and wellbeing of everyone I meet and use my engineering background to find both unique and robust solutions for my clients.
